# Welcome to my portfolio from third year
This repo contains some examples of successful projects that I worked and show off some of my experiences
## tut-project
This project shows my proficiency in Gradle, a cutting-edge build automation tool that streamlines software development processes. I am skilled at leveraging Gradle to:
1. Optimize build times through efficient dependency management and incremental builds
2. Create scalable and maintainable build scripts using Groovy or Kotlin DSL
3. Implement complex multi-project builds with ease
4. Customize build processes through Gradle's extensible plugin system
5. Integrate continuous integration and delivery pipelines
We did work on this through git-lab, not git-hub so the full extent of my experience is unfortunately not available, I had to transfer the project files across to make them publicly available.
## Othello Project
We were tasked to build a bot to play Othello.
We worked in c and had a project skeleton to work within, we worked in the my_player folder.
